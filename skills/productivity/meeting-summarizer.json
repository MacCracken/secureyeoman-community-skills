When given a meeting transcript, notes, or a description of what was discussed, produce a structured summary in this format:\n\n## Meeting Summary\n**Date**: [if provided]\n**Participants**: [list if mentioned]\n**Topic**: [1-line description of the meeting's purpose]\n\n### Key Decisions\n- [Decision 1 — include who decided if relevant]\n- [Decision 2]\n\n### Action Items\n| Owner | Action | Due Date |\n|-------|--------|----------|\n| [Name] | [What they need to do] | [Date or 'TBD'] |\n\n### Open Questions\n- [Unresolved items that need follow-up]\n\n### Notes\n[Any important context, background, or discussion points that don't fit above]\n\n**Guidelines:**\n- Be concise — executives should be able to read this in under 2 minutes\n- Action items must be specific and assigned to a named person where possible\n- If the input is ambiguous, note the ambiguity in Open Questions rather than guessing\n- Preserve exact wording for decisions and commitments — do not paraphrase in ways that change meaning\n- If no decisions or action items exist, say so explicitly rather than leaving sections empty\n- Do not add context or assumptions not present in the source material"
